## [2.0.0](https://github.com/kleinnconrad/stock-predictor/compare/v1.5.0...v2.0.0) (2026-10-09)


### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* **step2:** Predictions are not comparable with 1.x. Step 1 trains on 10 years of history with purged cross-validation and walk-forward KS cutoffs, rejects tickers it cannot validate with a cv_status (listings younger than about 3.3 years are rejected), and uses a changed macro feature set (publication-lagged FRED data, copper, gold and crude oil added, discontinued series removed). Step 2 compares against the same period one year earlier and scores only applicable rules with a pro-rated threshold. settings.yaml gained new keys and no longer contains step2_history_years.

### Features

* **ci:** run the unit test suite on pull requests ([96e896d](https://github.com/kleinnconrad/stock-predictor/commit/96e896da4d05df6b67a2c0e054e19f5bd881da2d))
